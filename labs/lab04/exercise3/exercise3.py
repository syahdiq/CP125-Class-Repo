# Exercise 3: Inventory Tracker
#
# This program tracks inventory and calculates restock costs.
# However, it contains bugs that cause incorrect output.
#
# Expected output for the test below:
#   Total value: $1450.00
#   Low stock (<10): [1, 3]
#   Restock cost: $1500.00
#
# Use the debugger to find and fix the bugs.
